# 14work

It's federal budget season and we thought you might like to know something about where the money goes. 

+ With your table buddy, use d3 to create a webpage that displays information about the federal budget form 2 different years.
    + Specifically, create a bar chart that shows budget data.
    + Use a transition effect when changing from one year to another.
+ This website has pretty good data on federal budgets going back to the 1900s: [http://federal-budget.insidegov.com](http://federal-budget.insidegov.com)
+ Example d3 code has been posted on the notes and code page: [https://github.com/stuy-softdev/notes-and-code/tree/master/smpl/90_d3](sample)
+ This will be due Monday in the AM

Submit this in the workshop under `14_d3-bars`
